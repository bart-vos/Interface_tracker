# Interface_tracker

Interface_tracker is a GUI for the analysis of vesicles, partly sucked up in a micropipette, undergoing a change in surface-to-volume ratio, causing the membrane of the vesicle to go deeper or less deep into the micropipette. The file [interface_tracker.py][interface_tracker.py] and [interface_tracker.ui][interface_tracker.ui] need to be in the same folder when running the .py file. Upon running the .py file, an interface opens where a time series of a vesicle that is partly sucked up in a micropipette. A rectangular ROI needs to be drawn around the interface. The 'Preview' buttons allows inspection of the ROI as a function of time. Pressing 'Analyse' tracks the interface throughout time. The 'Save' button saves a .txt file with the position in pixels per frame. A test file with the used parameters and expected analysis reults can be found in [this folder][test folder].
